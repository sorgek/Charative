# Charative

Unfinished

GOAL: A website designed for shared writing and blogging by letting people create creation of characters and worlds.

ACHIEVED: I never got to the world bits before going down the rabbit hole of social nonsense like chat / friends but did complete user auth, avatars, character creation, and adding friends before I got distracted.
